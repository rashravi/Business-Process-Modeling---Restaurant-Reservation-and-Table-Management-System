# Business-Process-Modeling---Restaurant-Reservation-and-Table-Management-System
This project is about a database management system for reservations and table management of a new standalone Restaurant and Wine bar. The database coordinates operations from the time a customer makes a reservation, to the time a customerâ€™s last order is placed and bill is generated to ensure smooth management of tables and orders by the restaurant staff. The scope of this project is to optimize table management and reservations, to improve both shift performance and diner experience and to make it easier to run front of the house
